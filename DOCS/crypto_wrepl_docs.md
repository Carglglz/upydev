# CryptoWebREPL

### Steps to enable encryption mode:

1. **Put 'upysecrets.py' in the device**: to do this use '**update_upyutils**' command as:

   `$ upydev update_upyutils`

   This will upload : 

   * sync_tool.py
   * upylog.py
   * upynotify.py
   * upysecrets.py (to enable encryption)
   * upysh2.py (to enable 'tree' command)

2. **Generate RSA-2048 bits private key** and **upload it to the device**:

   To generate the key do:

   `$ upydev gen_rsakey -tfkey` 

   *-tfkey* option is to send the key to the device (so use this if connected directly to the AP of the device or a "secure" wifi e.g. local/home) If not connected to a "secure" wifi upload the key (it is stored in upydev.\__path__) by USB/Serial connection.

After these two steps encryption mode is now available:

`$ upydev crypto_wrepl` 

Or if there is already a global "UPY_G" named group, any device can be accessed with this mode using:

e.g.:

`$ upydev upy@esp_room1`  or `$ upydev upy@192.168.1.42` 

```bash
$ upydev upy@esp_room1

### CryptoWebREPL protocol: AES - Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):

####  In every session two new keys are generated (one by the host, and one by the device) so encryption and decryption use different keys, as well as initialization vectors

* **Ciphers (aes256-cbc):** AES in CBC mode with a 256-bit key 

* **RSA-2048 bits private key:** The key is generated by the host and then uploaded to the device

* **The HANDSHAKE** (and key exchange method):

  * The host loads the RSA private key, generates 32 random bytes ( integers 0-255), then these bytes are used to select 32 values from the first 256 values of the RSA key. These values are added to the end of the RSA key, and using **sha256** the hash of key is computed. Then the session key is randomly generated selecting 32 values from the hash. The session IV is randomly generated selecting 16 values from the hash. The first 32 random bytes + 32 random index values of the hash + 16 random index values of hash makes the host token.
  * The host sends its token to the device so it can replicate the steps to generate the host session key and IV.
  * Then the devices generates its session key and session IV using the same method above, and sends its token to the host, so the host can replicate the steps to generate the device session key and IV.

  So in the token there is no explicit info about any key, the bytes in the token are just indexes.

* **E2EE communication (almost)**:

  Example:

  With encryption enabled, this command in the CryptoWebREPL:

  `>>> led.on()`

  Will look like this in the Websockets packages and Serial REPL:

  `>>> cp.crepl(b'886ab3a45537cbb40c951359e27265d3')`

  Or 

  ```
  >>> print('Hello')
  Hello
  
  >>>
  ```

  Will look like this:

  ```
  cp.crepl(b'32b73f35adc1e4332d4020bcc0268335')
  Hello # This is printed in the serial REPL but not forwarded to WebREPL
  b'1d9c213456f377e674643446defa0262' # This is what is forwarded to WebREPL
  ```

* **After exiting CryptoWebREPL**:

  The device will be soft-reset so session keys are erased from RAM.

### CryptoWebREPL : shell/repl

The CryptoWebREPL allows to toggle between shell and repl modes (Use 'CTRL-s' and then press 'ENTER' to do this)

The repl mode has some limitations:

- In encrypted mode the output of a command won't be received until its end (so no 'live output')

- In both encrypted and unencrypted modes CTRL-C cannot be use to break an infinite loop.

- To define a function/class or make a loop use the paste mode. (CTRL-E)

  *However the original WebREPL Terminal can be accesed from shell with 'wrepl' command*

  e.g.

  ```
  esp32@esp_room1:~ $ wrepl
  WARNING: ENCRYPTION DISABLED IN THIS MODE
  <-- Device esp32 MicroPython -->
  Use CTRL-x to exit, Use CTRL-k to see custom wrepl Keybdings

**To see keybindings / shell commands info do 'CTRL-k': This will print**:

Custom keybindings:
- CTRL-x : to exit CryptoWebREPL Terminal
